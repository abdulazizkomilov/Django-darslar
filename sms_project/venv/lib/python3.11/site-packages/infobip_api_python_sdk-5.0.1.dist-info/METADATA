Client SDK to use the Infobip API with Python.

This package enables you to use multiple Infobip communication channels, like SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, Email, etc.

---

## üì° Supported APIs

The following communication channels are supported:

- [SMS + 2FA](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/sms)
- [Whatsapp](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/whatsapp)
- [Email](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/email)
- [WebRTC](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/webrtc/)
- [MMS](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/mms)
- [RCS](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/rcs)

The following platform management APIs are supported:
- [Entities](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/platform/application-entity)

More APIs to be added in the near future.

## üîê Authentication

Currently, infobip-api-python-sdk only supports API Key authentication,
and the key needs to be passed during client creation.
This will most likely change with future versions,
once more authentication methods are included.

## üì¶ Installation

To install infobip SDK you will need to run:

```bash
pip install infobip-api-python-sdk
```

Details of the package can be found
in the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/infobip-api-python-sdk/).

## üöÄ Usage

### Code Example
To use the package you'll need an Infobip account.
If you don't already have one, you can create a free trial account
[here](https://www.infobip.com/signup).

In this example, we will show how to send a WhatsApp text message.
Other channels can be used in a similar way.
The first step is to import the necessary channel, in this case WhatsApp channel.

```python
from infobip_channels.whatsapp.channel import WhatsAppChannel
```

Now you can create instance of `WhatsAppChannel` with your `base_url` and `api_key`.

```python
c = WhatsAppChannel.from_auth_params({
    "base_url": "<your_base_url>",
    "api_key": "<your_api_key>"
})
```

Alternatively, you can create the instance from the environment, having the `IB_BASE_URL` and `IB_API_KEY` variables
set, like this:

```python
c = WhatsAppChannel.from_env()
```

After that you can access all the methods from `WhatsAppChannel`.
To send text message you can use `send_text_message` method and add correct payload:
```python
response = c.send_text_message(
    {
      "from": "<WhatsApp sender number from your Infobib account>",
      "to": "<Number that will receive WhatsApp message>",
      "messageId": "a28dd97c-1ffb-4fcf-99f1-0b557ed381da",
      "content": {
        "text": "Some text"
      },
      "callbackData": "Callback data",
      "notifyUrl": "https://www.example.com/whatsapp"
    }
)
```

### Samples

We are adding samples in the [samples](samples) folder, which you can use as a reference on how to use the SDK
with real payloads.
